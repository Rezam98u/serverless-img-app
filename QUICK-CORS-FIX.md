# üö® URGENT: Fix S3 CORS in 2 Minutes

## üéØ The Problem
Your S3 bucket `snapvault-images-reza` doesn't have CORS configured, so browsers block the upload.

## ‚ö° Quick Fix (AWS Console)

### Step 1: Open AWS S3 Console
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. Find and click on bucket: **`snapvault-images-reza`**

### Step 2: Configure CORS
1. Click on **"Permissions"** tab
2. Scroll down to **"Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)"**
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. **Delete any existing content** and paste this exactly:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "Authorization",
      "Content-Length",
      "Content-Type",
      "Date",
      "ETag",
      "User-Agent",
      "x-amz-content-sha256",
      "x-amz-date",
      "x-amz-security-token",
      "x-amz-checksum-crc32",
      "x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "PUT",
      "POST",
      "DELETE",
      "HEAD"
    ],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "ETag",
      "x-amz-version-id",
      "x-amz-delete-marker",
      "x-amz-checksum-crc32"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

### Step 3: Save
1. Click **"Save changes"**
2. Wait 30 seconds for propagation

### Step 4: Test
1. Go back to your React app
2. Try uploading the image again
3. ‚úÖ It should work now!

**Before (Current Error):**
```

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for full propagation
3. **Try in incognito/private browser window**
